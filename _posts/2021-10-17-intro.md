This is the firs post blog post on my personal website using GitHub pages. I don't think many hiring folks actually look at these but at least I have fun learning new programming topics. I used to have a static basically handwritter BootStrap 3 website but I got tired of paying for the domain name. I'm hoping to eventually use this to write some simple tests against in several different languages -- JS, Python, Java, and maybe C#.
