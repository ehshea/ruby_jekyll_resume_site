I'm detective at heart. Whether it's diseases or software bugs, I'll find them. I have parlayed a Master's Degree in Public Health with a concentration in Epidemiology into a solid career in Software Testing. My education instilled a strong grasp of the scientific method and provided ample hands-on experience testing hypotheses. I also learned to see patterns in biological data. These skills readily translate to Software Testing. As testers we must be objective and we must use the information at hand to assess risk and find defects in much the same way as an epidemiologist must track down the causes of disease.
